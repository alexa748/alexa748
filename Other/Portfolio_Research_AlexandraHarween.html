    <p>Here are the websites I consulted when researching porftolio sites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codementor.io/blog/Software-engineer-resume-2ouyh6n4f6">Codementor.io - How to Make a Killer Software Engineer Resume</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/careersmithing/programmer-portfolio/">Ultimate Guide to Creating a Programmer Portfolio</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-software-developer-portfolio-website-in-5-days-de3f86d1efee">Build a Software Developer Portfolio Website in 5 Days</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/minimal-web-design">Explore Minimalist Web Design</a>(this was for style inspiration)</li>
        </ul>

        I learned the following from reading through the articles above.
        <p>The "Ultimate Guide" article summarizes 3 key areas to cover: <i>About Me, Projects, and Contact.</i> </p>

        <p>Obviously, potential employers want to know what skills you have.  Include these both in written format such as a list of languages and certifications 
            and also show examples.  Take screenshots of your projects or your websites and write a brief description of the project, its challenges, and any problems
            you solved.
        </p>
        <p>The design, set-up and coding of your portfolio themselves will speak to your knowledge and work. Is it well-organized? Clear?
            Pleasing to look at? Functional?  If you are a designer, more weight is placed on the aesthetics, but even for backend
            developers you need to have a nice-looking site.
        </p>
        <p>Soft Skills: All of the articles said that these are important.  It's important that you can collaborate, problem-solve,
            and manage your time.  Do you have leadership skills? It's also OK to let some of your personality show through, whether it's from your writing style,
            a photograph, or a description of what you're like.
        </p>
