    <p>It was a really fun experience to build the portfolio website for the final project.  It's different when you apply 
        everything you've learned to one project and see how it all comes together as opposed to doing individual exercises
        as we did throughout the term.</p>
        <p>I clearly learned the use of having a separate CSS sheet.  It was a relief to know that anytime I wanted to change
            something like a background color or a heading font, I knew exactly where to do it and only had to do it once. I saw
            how you can come up with different ways of naming your classes and id's that make sense and are easy to find.</p>
        <p>The biggest challenge for me was knowing how to place elements and how to size them. At first I was using pixels
            for everything, but the more I read online the more it made sense to use percentages for consistency across screen sizes.
            Still, often I thought I had all the percentages for an element and its children lined up
            correctly, but when I went to run it ended up with a misaligned design. I learned that there are many approaches to positioning elements 
            and I wish I'd had more time to learn them and tools like the grid approach, Bootstrap, and Flexbox. 
        </p>
        <p>This experience might (and I hope will) help my career because it was a complete project from concept, through design,
        code, revisions, and testing.  It made me grasp the purpose of HTML semantic elements and ways to structure a page.
        It showed me shortcuts for CSS - not that I know them all, but I see how you can often combine values and selectors which
        makes the styling more efficient.  I learned how clear comments make it much easier to understand what you are doing 
        in both the HTML and the CSS.</p>
        
        <p>Perhaps <em>most importantly,</em> I saw how website creation is a process that develops and changes.  At the outset
        I thought I had a really clear idea of the layout and color scheme I wanted, and by the end it had changed completely! Many ideas
    arose as I was working.  In this very small example, I learned that valuable lesson which is integral to software development.</p>
